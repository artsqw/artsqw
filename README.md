- I'm building small **personal projects** while actively learning new technologies
- I'm also passively exploring topics in **computer engineering** and system fundamentals
- I’m confident in using **AI tools** like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, and **DeepSeek** to support my — development process — not just copying code, but applying them **effectively and thoughtfully**
